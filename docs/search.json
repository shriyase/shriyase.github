    "text": "Hi, I’m a Data Science Master’s student at the University of Michigan. I completed my Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering from PES University.\nProfessionally, my interests are broad, and lie in the applications of Machine Learning, especially in Generative AI and broadly Natural Language Processing. Over the summer I worked at Wellfyn, where I worked on developing an LLM-based chatbot to serve as a financial investment advisor. In the winter I developed an assistant to intuitively schedule tasks onto a user’s calendar and help manage it. I like to give back to the community and am currently volunteering as a data analyst with the Detroit Riverfront Conservancy.\nAside from that, I enjoy writing, singing and surfing. I spend a lot of time reading random bits of information online, and I even won at a nationally televised quiz conducted by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. I’m also part of the kayaking club and the powerlifting club here at UofM!"
