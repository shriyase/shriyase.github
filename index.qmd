Hi, I'm a Data Science Master's student at the [University of Michigan](https://lsa.umich.edu/stats/masters_students/mastersprograms/data-science-masters-program.html). I completed my Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from [PES University](https://pes.edu/).

Professionally, my interests are broad, and lie in the applications of Machine Learning, especially in Generative AI and broadly Natural Language Processing. 
Over the summer I worked at Wellfyn, where I worked on developing an LLM-based chatbot to serve as a financial investment advisor. In the winter I developed an assistant to intuitively schedule tasks onto a user's calendar and help manage it. 
I like to give back to the community and am currently volunteering as a data analyst with the Detroit Riverfront Conservancy.

Aside from that, I enjoy writing, singing and surfing. I spend a lot of time reading random bits of information online, and I even won at a nationally televised quiz conducted by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
I'm also part of the kayaking club and the powerlifting club here at UofM!
